# Car Price Prediction
Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project tackles the challenge of predicting used car prices using linear regression, a fundamental machine learning technique. The model estimates a linear relationship between various car features and their corresponding market prices based on ar Name (Brand & Model) Manufacturer Company Fuel Type (e.g., gasoline, diesel, electric) Kilometers Driven (odometer reading) Year of Manufacture.

# Criminal Face Recognition


[Project 1: Criminal Face Recognition](https://github.com/tariqahmedproject/Criminal-Face-Recognition)

*The Face Recognition system In which admin input details about criminal like name , father name and other details and photo of criminal and the system process the photo and compare the with database and show output about the photo this person is criminal or not .

*For Security Agency it difficult to Identify the criminal in public place.it is also difficult and time consuming task to find in public place. 

*Our face is a unique and important part of human body This system provides for security agency that uses face recognition to track or view individual targets from the camera. This will help to security agency or police to catch the criminal.

**Main Menu**
This is our main menu in this section there are three section.

1) CFR, In this section we can store data about criminal like name , father name and sample photo etc.
2) Criminal Face Recognition
3) Password change
